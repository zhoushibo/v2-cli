# TOOLS.md - Local Notes Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup. ## What Goes Here Things like: - Camera names and locations - SSH hosts and aliases - Preferred voices for TTS - Speaker/room names - Device nicknames - Anything environment-specific ## Examples ```markdown ### Cameras - living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle - front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered ### SSH - home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin ### TTS - Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British) - Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod ``` ## Why Separate? Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure. --- Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet. ## 🔑 GitHub 配置（重要！） - **账号：** zhoushibo - **认证方式：** SSH（永远不要用 HTTPS Token） - **SSH Key：** 已配置（`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`） - **仓库前缀：** `git@github.com:zhoushibo/` - **常用命令：** ```bash git remote set-url origin git@github.com:zhoushibo/<repo>.git git push -u origin master ``` - **❌ 错误做法：** 不要用 `https://github.com/` 或 `ghproxy.net` 代理 --- **最后更新：** 2026-02-21（因为记忆系统失效，特意记录）
